# Quotes

Application that allows you to store, add, edit and delete quotes. There are simple CRUD endpoints that allows to do this.
A quote is an object that has attributes such as the name and surname of the author and the content of the quote.

Made in Java11, using H2 memory database to store quotes, JPA to connect with db and Maven to manage and organize dependencies.
Tests made with JUnit, are checking if endpoints works correctly.
Also using lombok to eliminate some boilerplate code.

URL for tests in postman after starting the app: http://localhost:8080/api/quotes
